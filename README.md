-In this project, I created a travel website using Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. Throughout the development process, I aimed to provide a user-friendly and mobile-responsive experience.

-By leveraging Next.js and TypeScript, I developed a robust React application with a page-based architecture, enhancing both performance and development speed. 

-Tailwind CSS formed the foundation for the project's style and design, offering ease and flexibility in designing a responsive user interface. 

-I took advantage of Tailwind's convenience and adaptability to craft an interface adhering to responsive design principles, ensuring smooth navigation across various devices such as mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.


## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
